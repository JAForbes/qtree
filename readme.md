QTree
=====

Note:

This is an ES6 project.  Once it matures a little bit I'll provide precompiled
ES5 with every tagged release.

But I figure it won't be long until Node uses ES6 so I'm going for it
because generators make the code a lot nicer.

Usage:
------

I'll add usage soon.  But for now see the `tests` folder.


To run the tests
----------------

```
#install dependencies
npm install

#run the test suite
iojs node_modules/mocha/bin/_mocha --watch test/qtree.js
```
